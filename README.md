Case 4: This Database is designed for Coderstrust Survey 2021

This database has been designed specifically to Coderstrust in order to analyze users' individual interested in three work fields.

The database contains a DDL and DML script.

1. Execute the DDL script creating the five tables individually.
2. Use the 'Table Data Wizard Import' in MySQLWorkbench to import all the different tables.
3. Once the data has been imported, open the DML script and use one of the scripts in order to show each table content.
4. There has been provided a script in order to create a 'View' for each of the three work fields.

The Survey_final_document is a spreadsheet which contains information from 50 fictive users. 

Warning: When using the Wizard import on Questions.csv, make sure to disable all the boxes with "MyUnknownColumn". Any doubts about this can be clarified in the png-file.

Errors with this database: When importing the Survey.csv file, be aware that it only imports 22 records out of 50. This error was not fixed in time.
